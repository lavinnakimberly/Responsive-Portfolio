			<img src="assets/images/lavinna.jpg" class="auth-image" alt="Lavinna"/>
				<p>I'm timid at first, but I promise you the fun loving side of me starts to come out. I was born and raised in sunny San Diego and love to stay active. I played volleyball, basketball, and tennis growing up and enjoyed outdoor activities. Nowadays, you can find me hiking or hanging out at the beach on the weekends. I'm open to learning new sports and taking on new hobbies.
				</p>
				<br>
				<p>I was always interested in seeing the world and developed a strong wanderlust after studying abroad in Japan in college. Since I became a travel bug, I jumped on the opportunity to do an internship in Germany. Words cannot express how amazing both experiences were to be able to live in another country, meet new people, and immerse in a completely different culture.
				</p>
				<br>
				<p>I also think of myself as a food enthusiast because I love trying new food and trendy new restaurants. I like to cook and love to experiment with new recipes. I appreciate all tastes of the world.</p>
